# Loan Approval Predictive Modeling

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the factors influencing credit risk in loan approval decisions and develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of default for loan applicants.

## Questions and Analysis

1. **Key Factors Influencing Credit Risk**: Analyzed the key factors influencing credit risk in loan approval decisions.

2. **Demographic Variables and Default Likelihood**: Explored how demographic variables such as age, income, and education affect the likelihood of default.

3. **Role of Credit History**: Investigated the role of credit history, including credit score and previous defaults, in assessing credit risk.

4. **Employment and Financial Indicators**: Examined specific employment or financial indicators that correlate with loan repayment.

5. **Predictive Model for Default Prediction**: Explored the feasibility of building a predictive model that accurately predicts the likelihood of default for loan applicants.

6. **Suitable Machine Learning Algorithms**: Identified the most suitable machine learning algorithms for the binary classification task of predicting loan default.

7. **Handling Imbalanced Classes**: Discussed strategies for handling imbalanced classes in the target variable.

8. **Preprocessing Steps**: Outlined the necessary preprocessing steps for data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature selection.

9. **Evaluation Metrics**: Discussed appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for assessing the model's performance.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing credit risk and the feasibility of developing a predictive model for loan default prediction.
